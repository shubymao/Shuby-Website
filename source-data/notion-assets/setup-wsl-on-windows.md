## Introduction

Windows Subsystem for Linux or WSL for short allows you to run Linux virtually within windows. This enables developers to run, test, and develop within the Linux environment as servers tend to run using Linux.

## Installing WSL

Start from a fresh windows machine. First, install the WSL by starting a power shell instance by running the following

```powershell
wsl --install
```

This will install wsl 2 by default.

## Installing Distro

Go into the Microsoft Store and install your preferred Linux distribution. Here we will install Ubuntu as many of the common workflows will have instructions for it online.
